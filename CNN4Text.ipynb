    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will implement a Convolutional Neural Network, a neural network architecture, which has been commonly utilized for image classification problems, to classify movie reviews from http://rottentomoatoes.com. These movie reviews, either from critics or public audience, are either \"Fresh\", conveying a positive overall review, or \"Rotten\" for negative ones. We will train & evaluate a CNN model to classify 1-sentence movie reviews from Rottentomatoes.com."

    "CNN is a multi layered neural network architecture. Several CNN variants (e.g. LeNet, AlexNet) have yielded very good results in image classification problems. Advances in GPU computing in the last decade made it much easier and faster to train CNNs on large image datasets. Although the current accuracy world records for image classification (e.g. the [ImageNet ILSVRC challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/)) are held by much more complicated and deeper networks, e.g. the 152-layer ResNet, which was the first network to surpass human accuracy level (2015), and Inception v3 (2016), convolution is still at the core of these advanced  networks."

    "### What is convolution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is a mathematical operation, combining two functions (signals) to generate a new signal. Historically, convolution has been an essential tool in DSP (Digital Signal Processing), e.g. an impulse response signal can be convolved with base signal to render a certain effect. For example, in audio processing, impulse response samples have been utilized to add the hallmark 'reverb' effect of famous concert halls to studio recordings, see [Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_reverb). \n",

    "In DSP, convolution (as illustrated above) is usually performed on continuous signals. In image processing, convolution of discrete signals, represented by matrices, yields a class of filters that allow us to manipulate images in several different ways. Convolution filters could be configured to sharpen, blur, or even detect edges in a given image. A greyscale image can be represented as a large matrix, one matrix entry per pixel, a kernel matrix (much smaller matrix), can be convolved with original matrix (image) as illustrated below. Colored images can be processed as separate channels (RGB), so a colored image is represented by 3 (greyscale) matrices.\n",

    "### How do convolution networks work for image classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "One major challenge for classical classification algorithms when applied to image datasets is the inherent high-dimensionality of the data. If each row of the dataset is a 300x300 image, this actually yields a flattened 90,000-dimensional dataset! \n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs, on the other hand, utilize several convolution & pooling (e.g. Max pooling, a moving window extracting pixel of highest value) layers for both dimension reduction & feature selection processes. The \"weights\" of the convolution kernels (along with weights for activation functions, e.g. ReLU) are iteratively optimized in the process. Optimization is performed to minimize a certain \"loss\" function, whose optimal minimal value corresponds to a high classification accuracy. \"Stochastic Gradient Descent\" is a common algorithm for the minimization of the loss function. The weights are updated each iteration based on a back-probagation scheme (mathematically = chain rule) to update the gradient based on the error in classification in previous iteration. \n",

    "### How would they work for text classification!?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of each word (token) of a sentence as a row in a matrix. Technically, each row is rather a numeric vector representation of the given token, usually via a word embedding algorithm like Word2Vec, GLoVe, or even a simple one-hot encoding to index each word with respect to the corpus of words/tokens in our dataset. So, for example, a 10-word sentence (with vector embedding in a 100 dimensional space) can be represented by a 10X100 matrix (image!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution filters in this case, have the same width, say a 100 per prior example, and height may vary depending on the use-case, covering 2-5 word span is typical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But still, sentences are not very similar to images!\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that is in fact true, adjacent words in a sentence (per grammar & syntax rules) are not really similar to adjacent pixels in an image. Besides, certain intuitive image transformations do not yield meaningful results for language applications. So how should we expect CNNs to yield good results? \n",
    "\n",
    "Shouldn't we use better suited architectures (e.g. RNNs, LSTMs, Sequence-to-sequence models) for NLP applications? That is also true, but from practical experience, CNNs still deliver good accuracy for simple language tasks, and the real gain here is that they are much easier and faster to train compared to other more advanced architectures. For more complicated language tasks, e.g. question answering, more specialized & elaborate architectures may be required, see [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) for more on the latest developments.\n",

    "For this particular use-case the network used is based on the one introduced in the paper [\"Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) (see above image) with minor changes, as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Paper utilizes 2 channels for the input layer (see image above), one is static (constant through training), and a dynamic layer that is fine-tuned via back probagation. We'll have only one static channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will not utilize a pre-built embedding model (e.g. Word2vec or GLoVe), but instead, an embedding layer will be implemented to \"learn\" the embedding during the training of the model.\n",

    "* We pad the sentences to have all the same length, 59 words/tokens per sentence per our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Filter sizes, i.e. the number of words we want our convolutional filters to cover. For example, [3, 4, 5] means that we will have filters that slide over 3, 4 and 5 words respectively, for a total of 3 * num_filters filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural network models tend to overfit over the training data, so a regularization mechanism will help in this regard. Standard regularization techniques (e.g. L1 (LASSO), L2 (ridge)) have been found not to be very effective for these models, see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03820) for more detailed information. Instead, the \"Dropout\" technique is used. The idea behind the dropout technique is to randomly disable a number of neurons in the network, so as to prevent too many neurons from co-adapting, and hence force the neurons to individiually learn more relevant features."
